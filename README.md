### Fix It!

Fix It! is a Chrome Extension that allows you to easily fix websites clients, adding simple funcionalities or correcting bugs.  
It works like this: you write a small js snippet to fix the problem, and set Fix It! to run that code everytime you open a specific domain.  
If it works, you can upload your fix to the server, and everyone will be able to see a gallery of most used and better rated fixes for their current domain.  

### Current Status

As of now, it's in beta! The core is already working, but there is a lot to do.  

You can already check it out in the store:  
https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fixit/paeepofhgohgbabngblbdcdimpjegpoo  

Or clone and take a look at what it does.  
There are a few open issues that delineate the expected path of upcoming progress.
