### Fix It!

Fix It! is an upcoming project of a awesome chrome extension that allows you to easily fix websites clients, adding simple funcionalities or correcting bugs.
It works like this: you write the js to fix the problem, and set Fix It! to run that js everytime you open that domain.
If it works, you can upload your fix to the server, and everyone will be able to see a gallery of most used and better rated fixes for their current domain.
